# Live_Stock-Application
An application which fetches live data of stock rates from the website.

This application is a live update of the stock rates and increase/decrease of the stock prices.
The data is fetched from the Internet using REST API services in JSON format. The stock is view in a Recycler View Adapter. 
The user can add the stock value using the add button by its name or company name to give all the other details(decrease percent,stock value,company name,color)in the view.
It does not allow duplicate stock values as prompts the alert box.
I have also used Swipe Refresher to give the data of app up-to-date. You can also go to the website of the stock by clicking on the stock because of Intent Activity usage.

Used:Toasts,Alert dialogues, Intent,SavedInstance,Life-cycle,Internet services,AsyncTask.
